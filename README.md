**HybridCORELS** is a Python module for learning Hybrid Rule-Based/Black-Box models, using modified versions of the CORELS algorithm for the rule-based part learning.
It is based on the CORELS Python binding, [PyCORELS](https://github.com/corels/pycorels).

Both our proposed algorithms provide **optimality guarantees** and allow **direct control of the desired transparency level** (proportion of examples classified by the interpretable part of the hybrid interpretable model).

If you encounter any issue when using this module please either open a ticket here or email `jferry@laas.fr`.
This package is joint work between Julien Ferry, Gabriel Laberge and Ulrich Aïvodji.

## Learning Optimal Hybrid Interpretable Models with Fixed Transparency Level

Hybrid interpretable models are predictive models formed by an interpretable and a black-box part. The interpretable part makes predictions, and the black-box handles the examples not captured by the later. Hereafter are two examples of such models learnt on the exact same data using the two methods proposed within this module:

</p>

This module contains our two proposed algorithms introduced in Section 4 of our paper. They implement the two hybrid interpretable models learning paradigms identified in Section 3.1:

* `HybridCORELSPreClassifier` uses the *Pre-Black-Box* paradigm: the interpretable part of the Hybrid model is trained first, using a modified version of the CORELS algorithm. Given a desired minimum transparency level, the algorithm returns the certifiaby optimal prefix, minimizing the overall model classification error lower bound. Then, a BB model is trained to perform well on the remaining examples. The BB can then be specialized on such examples. In this case, optimality is certified for the interpretable part alone, which is guaranteed to have the best objective function given the coverage constraint. The intuition for this type of approach is to handle the "easy" examples using the interpretable part of the model, and leverage the black-box complexity to classify the hardest ones.

*  `HybridCORELSPostClassifier` uses the *Post-Black-Box* paradigm: the BB part of the Hybrid model is trained first. Then, the interpretable part is trained, using a modified version of the CORELS algorithm. Given a desired minimum transparency level, along with the BB predictions, the algorithm returns the certifiaby optimal prefix. Because it is trained after the BB, the interpretable part is able to correct its mistakes. In this case, optimality is certified for the interpretable part, but regarding the overall model's predictions. Indeed, the overall model is guaranteed to have the best objective function given the coverage constraint and the black-box mistakes.

## Installation

Two options are possible:

* installation from source: clone this repository and do `python setup.py install`
* via the PyPi project (TODO): `pip install HybridCORELS`

## Organization of the Repository

Folder `HybridCORELS` contains the code for our module.

Folder `paper` contains all the code we used to perform the experiments and plots presented in our paper.
It also contains the raw results for our large-scale experiments. All the scripts needed to treat them and generate the Figures are provided.
Raw results for Section 5.2 (*Exploring the Pre-Black-Box Paradigm*) are provided within `paper/results_part_3_collab.zip`.
Raw results for Section 5.3 (*Tradeoffs and Comparison with the State of the Art*) are provided within `paper/results_part_4.zip`.
Raw results for the Appendix C.2 (*HybridCORELSPre,NoCollab: Empirical Evaluation*) are provided within `paper/results_part_3.zip`.

Folder `examples` contains example uses of our different methods. The `example_HybridCORELSPre.py` script trains a `HybridCORELSPreClassifier`, displays it and evaluates it on a test set. The `example_HybridCORELSPost_pretrained_black_box.py` (respectively, `example_HybridCORELSPost.py`) script does the same using a `HybridCORELSPostClassifier` with a given pretrained black-box model (respectively, with no given pretrained black-box).

**IMPORTANT: in the `data` folders (within `./examples` or `./paper`) the only dataset ready to use is `compas_mined.csv`.
For Adult and ACS Employment, the rules must first be mined from the raw datasets before experiments can be run.
This is due to the large size of the mined datasets, which do not fit on the repository.
You can easily generate the mined versions for all datasets with `python run_rules_mining.py` within the `paper` folder.**

Hereafter is a minimal running example (requiring the scikit-learn library as a `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier()` will be used by default as black-box part) that should be launched from the `examples` folder:

```python
from HybridCORELS import *

# Load data
X, y, features, prediction = load_from_csv("./data/compas_mined.csv")

# Define a hybrid model that will use the Pre-Black-Box training paradigm
# We want a transparency greater than 80%
# We set max_card to 1 as rule mining is already done in our dataset
hyb_model = HybridCORELSPreClassifier(min_coverage=0.8, max_card=1)

# Trains it
hyb_model.fit(X, y, features=features, prediction_name=prediction, time_limit=60, memory_limit=4000)

# Displays it
print(hyb_model)
```

Expected output:

Example Hybrid Model learnt on the COMPAS dataset using HybridCORELSPre (minimum desired transparency 0.8) along with a standard sklearn RandomForest as black-box model (minimal running example provided in this README).

This minimal example also works replacing `HybridCORELSPreClassifier` by `HybridCORELSPostClassifier`, to learn hybrid interpretable models using the *Post-Black-Box* paradigm.

## Detail of the Methods' Hyperparameters

### `HybridCORELSPreClassifier`

#### Classifier Object Hyperparameters

* **obj_mode**: Type of learning objective for the *Pre-Black-Box* paradigm. If 'collab', maximizes (prefix accuracy + BB accuracy UB) - i.e., takes care of the inconsistent examples let to the BB part (as in Section 4.4 of our paper). If 'no_collab', only maximizes the prefix's accuracy (as in the Appendix C of our paper) (default: 'collab')
        
* **black_box_classifier**: user-provided object for the black-box part of the interpretable model - note that this classifier object must follow sklearn naming conventions, and in particular implement the .fit() method with cost-sensitive training (i.e., the `sample_weight` parameter). It does not need to be trained as it will be trained automatically after learning the interpretable part (default: sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier())

* **alpha**: black-box specialization coefficient (used to weight the black-box training set) (default: 0.0 (i.e., no specialization))

* **beta**: float, regularization hyperparameter weighting transparency in the objective function. When using the min_coverage hard constraint,
        we recommend to set beta < 1/n_samples <= c (default: 0.0)

* **min_coverage**: float (between 0.0 and 1.0), minimum acceptable value for the hybrid model transparency (proportion of examples classified by the interpretable part of the model) (default 0.0 (i.e., no constraint))

* Arguments of the original CORELS algorithm (see [PyCORELS documentation](https://github.com/corels/pycorels/blob/master/corels/corels.py) for more details)
    * **c**: regularization coefficient for sparsity ($\lambda$) (default: 0.001)
    * **n_iter**: maximum number of nodes in the prefix tree (default: 10**7) - because we now offer precise control over the memory use we suggest to set this parameter to a very high value and control the memory use using the `memory_limit` argument of the `.fit()` method
    * **map_type**: type of map used to cut down the prefix tree symmetries (default: "prefix")
    * **policy**: ordering criterion for the priority queue (defines in which order the prefix tree will be explored) (default: "lower_bound")
    * **verbosity**: list of required verbosity levels. Among others, "rulelist" prints the trained rule list when finished, "progress" displays information about the search, "mine" shows the mined rules and "hybrid" (new possible value) prints information regarding the Hybrid model learning framework (default: ["hybrid"])
    * **ablation**: indicates which bounds to use while searching (default: 0 (all bounds))
    * **max_card**: maximum rules cardinality (number of involved attributes) (default: 2). When dealing when pre-mined rules, this parameter should be set to 1
    * **min_support**: minimum support that rules must have in order to be used (default: 0.01)

(this timeout considers only the interpretable part building using the modified CORELS algorithm).
Note that this specifies the CPU time and NOT THE WALL-CLOCK TIME
(default: None (i.e., no limit))

(this memory limit considers only the interpretable part building using the modified CORELS algorithm)
(default: None (i.e., no limit))
